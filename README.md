## Project 3 Information
- Gained experience interpreting functional descriptions and assignment specifications, breaking a project into manageable components, and writing and executing non-web server Node.js JS using VSCode
- Practiced creating and using code modules, as well as refactoring using modern JS syntax
- Gained experience using Fastify with GET verb, routes, and query parameters, as well as loading a file and using a web page

This project introduced Fastify, which gave me the tools to succeed in all later server-based Node.js JS files
